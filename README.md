# UCSD Extension bootcamp HW 1

## HTML/CSS code refractory

With provided a basic landing page source code with assets of a digital maketing agency, student had to recontruct the html code to be more semantic and accessible for screen readers and users. Also, student had impoved the CSS codebase for a long term sustainability such as appling the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) rule, making the code reusable by removing redundant and overspecific codes on similar elements.
